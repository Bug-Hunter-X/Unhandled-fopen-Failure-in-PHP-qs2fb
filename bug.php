```php
$file = fopen("test.txt", "r+");
if ($file) {
    // ... process the file ...
    fclose($file);
}
```
This code has a potential issue: it doesn't check if `fopen` failed. If the file "test.txt" doesn't exist or is inaccessible, `fopen` will return `false`. The code proceeds to use the `$file` variable as if it were a valid resource handle, causing undefined behavior.
